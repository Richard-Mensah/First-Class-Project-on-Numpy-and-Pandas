**Step 1**:

Calculate the total profit for each of the product using the formula
net_revenue_per_capital = (retail_price - wholesale_prise)*sales

**Step 2**:
Determine the following

- How much total revenue you receive from all these sales?
- What product is product retail price more than twice the wholesale price?
- How much did the store make from food vs. computer vs. book?
- Because your store is doing so well,you are able to negotiate a 30% discount on the wholesale price of goods. Calcute the new net revenue
